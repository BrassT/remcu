Description of Library
======================
The REMCU Lib is a cross-platform library designed for remote access to 
internal peripherals of various MCU and SoC as if these peripherals were a part 
of your computer.
The library gives access a user space program to all peripherals of the remote 
chip  through the same API as peripheral drivers from Software Development 
Kit (SDK) provided by semiconductor chip vendors or third parties for MCU 
firmware development. 
Thereby a developer doesnâ€™t need to learn new tools but can just reuse his 
firmware code and examples of the SDK in his code designed for personal or 
embedded computers.
Firmware and protocol communication development are not required, because the
REMCU Lib translates itself the local API function call on computer to the call 
of the same function of peripheral driver on the remote chip.
